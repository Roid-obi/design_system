## Common Troubleshooting

Below are common issues that come up when using design_system. Have any of these worked for your problem?

- [ ] I have the latest design_system version
- [ ] If I have modified any design_system components, I have run `npm run build` to regenerate the `dist/index.js` file
- [ ] If I am using a local copy of design_system in my React app, I have avoided a [Hooks version collision](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#duplicate-react) by [linking](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#duplicate-react) the same versions of React and styled-components into both my apps
